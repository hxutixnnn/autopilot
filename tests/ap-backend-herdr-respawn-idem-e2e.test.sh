# tests/ap-backend-herdr-respawn-idem-e2e.test.sh - isolated real-herdr
# regression test for autopilot-restart idempotency against herdr's
# restored-layout husks (docs/herdr-backend.md "Known gaps" / "ID stability
# across a server restart").
#
# herdr persists its whole session layout (workspaces/tabs/panes) and
# restores it after a server restart, including a reboot. Before this fix, a
# restored ap-<id> task tab came back a husk - a dead pane, or a plain
# agent-less shell in the saved cwd - and bin/backends/herdr.sh's
# ap_backend_herdr_create_task refused to spawn into it unconditionally,
# because a same-labeled tab already existed. Every fleet respawn after a
# real herdr server restart needed the operator to manually close each husk
# pane first (this reproduced again on 2026-07-03).
#
# This test drives a REAL `herdr session stop` + fresh `herdr server` restart
# (the same "ID stability" mechanism docs/herdr-backend.md already documents:
# the pane survives alive, but agent_status resets and nothing is registered
# in it - exactly the restored-plain-shell husk shape), then proves
# ap_backend_herdr_create_task now closes-and-replaces the resulting husk
# instead of refusing, while a GENUINELY live duplicate (a real registered
# agent, via herdr's own `pane report-agent`) still refuses exactly as
# before. Adapter-level (ap_backend_herdr_container_ensure/create_task), not
# through the full bin/ap-spawn.sh + treehouse pipeline - mirrors
# tests/ap-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh's own style, and avoids any
# question of whether treehouse itself supports re-acquiring a worktree for
# an id that already has one checked out (a separate, out-of-scope concern).
#
# Safety (tests/herdr-test-safety.sh): cleanup uses ONLY
# herdr_safe_stop_and_delete, never a bare/inline-prefixed `herdr server
# stop` - the exact category of unscoped destructive call that caused the
# 2026-07-02 incident. Every herdr lifecycle call in this file targets this
# test's own isolated $SESSION explicitly via --session; the live `default`
# session is never touched.
